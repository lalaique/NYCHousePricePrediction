# NYC House Price Prediction

Estimating the value of a house would be valuable yet challenging for both potential sellers and buyers. While the real estate market can be unreliable and inefficient, this project aims to predict house prices based on the housing features in New York City in 2015 with several regression models.

This project performed several data preprocessing techniques, including detection of outliers, skewness, missing values imputations, normalization, etc. It also experimented various encoders for categorical variables, including one-hot, mean encoding, and group-by encoding. Lastly the project compared model performance of Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting.
